About authors
-------------

Gazu is written by CG Wire, a company based in France. We help small to
midsize CGÂ studios to manage their production and build pipeline
efficiently.

We apply software craftmanship principles as much as possible. We love
coding and consider that strong quality and good developer experience
matter a lot. Our extensive knowledge allows studios to get better at
managing production and doing software. They can focus more on the artistic
work.
